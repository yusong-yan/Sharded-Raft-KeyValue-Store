# Sharded-RaftKV

##### Some features of the project:
###### -    Raft and key/value storage system can be tested also can be runned as client and server (checkout makefile for running)
###### -    File and folder structure are different from what MIT provided, so the tests and main program are separated. Also it makes most of the code reusable for testing and running purpose
